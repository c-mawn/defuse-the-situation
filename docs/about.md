# About


Our general design process started with the finalization of creating this physical implementation of 'Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes'. Once we decided this, we started coming up with our modules.

In the original game




## Data Energy Flow Diagram
<img src="assets/DtS_Energy_Flow_Diagram.png" alt="Data Energy Flow Diagram" width="1000px">

A few notes to make this diagram a little clearer:
- There are only 2 users of the game, so all the users with scissors (defuser) are the same person.
- The pink 'Human Perception' lines are meant to reprisent a flow of data that is aquired or transmitted through human perception. This differs from our normal green 'Data' lines because there are no mistakes in transmitting that data, whereas with a human perception line, mistakes can (and will) be made, which is an intentional design decision of our game.
- The small seperated piece of the diagram in the bottom left is the system between the two users. The instructor gets information from the manual, then transmits that to the defuser, while the defuser is transmitting data regarding the game state to the instructor.
