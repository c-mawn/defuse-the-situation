Learning goals:
- Cut Arduino IDE out of my life by switching to PlatformIO
- Learn how to interface with a display using a microcontroller
- Research and develop the electrical components of the modules
- Create good documentation, establish consistent design rules, and set up maintainable systems
- Hopefully work on modularity: I think hot swappable modules would be really cool

### Charlie Mawn

Learning Goals:
- Expanding on my own knowledge of how to program arduino
- Learning how to use PlatformIO to write Arduino code without the terrible Arduino IDE
- Gain a better understand of how to integrate electrical and software components together
- Get a baseline understanding of how the mechanical components are designed to house the electronics

### Alex Mineeva
